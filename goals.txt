My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
As I look ahead to the coming year, I have set clear and ambitious goals that reflect my commitment to personal growth, leadership, and impact. These goals are deeply aligned with my long-term vision of becoming a changemaker and problem-solver for underserved communities.

Grow and Scale My Business Startup:
One of my top priorities is to accelerate the growth of my startup, Wonder Empowered Foundation, by expanding its reach and impact. I aim to develop more sustainable programs, build strategic partnerships, and explore innovative solutions to support students in marginalized communities. My goal is to move from a grassroots initiative to a more structured and scalable organization that can create long-term educational and social value.

Become the Problem-Solver I Aspire to Be:
As I continue my journey in the ALX Pathway program, I am committed to applying the knowledge and skills I acquire to real-world challenges. By the time I complete the course, I want to confidently demonstrate the critical thinking, leadership, adaptability, and creative problem-solving skills necessary to design and implement effective solutions in both business and community settings.

Earn the Swaniker Scholarship:
I am actively working toward becoming a Swaniker Scholar, an opportunity that aligns with my values of leadership, excellence, and service. Being part of this network will not only provide me with valuable mentorship and resources but also connect me with a community of like-minded, visionary young Africans who are driving change across the continent.

Gain Admission into My Dream U.S. College and Begin My Academic Journey:
A major milestone I am determined to achieve is securing admission to one of my dream colleges in the United States. I have refined my applications, strengthened my personal story, and remained resilient through years of preparation. In 2026, I hope to not only gain admission but also begin my undergraduate studies in Computer science, setting the stage for a career dedicated to sustainable development and educational equity.

These goals represent more than just personal aspirationsâ€”they are steps toward fulfilling my mission of empowering others and creating lasting change in the communities I care deeply about. With focus, discipline, and the right opportunities, I am confident that 2025 will be a transformational year in my journey.
