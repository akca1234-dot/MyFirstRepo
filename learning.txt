So far in this course, I have learned how to use GitHub to collaborate on coding projects and manage version control. I now understand how to fork a repository, make changes to files like README.md, commit those changes, and create a pull request. Iâ€™ve also learned how to clone a repository to my local machine, create new files, and push them back to GitHub using Git commands. These skills have helped me build confidence in using GitHub for real-world collaboration and open-source contributions.
